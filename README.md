🏥 Healthcare Data Model

This project builds a healthcare data warehouse in SQL Server with:

📂 5 Source Systems → Eligibility, Claims, Care Management, Provider, Reference (50 tables with dummy data).

⭐ Star Schema → Denormalized dimensions for fast BI reporting.

❄️ Snowflake Schema → Normalized dimensions for governance & reduced redundancy.

📊 Fact Tables → Claims, Encounters, Eligibility, and Care Gaps.

🗂 Dimensions → Date, Member, Plan, Provider, Diagnosis, Procedure, POS, Quality Measure.

🔍 Designed for SQL practice (joins, aggregations) and analytics (cost, utilization, quality performance).
⚡ Can be explored in SSMS or connected to BI tools like Power BI/Tableau.
